# MedicalCheatSheets

A simple static jekyll blog about medical pathologies, with small cheat sheets
as posts or articles. the blog is written in **French** and articles are added gradually.


The blog includes a progressive web app (pwa) functionality for offline reading:

- Data is precached in the browser using [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/).

- Updating to get latest articles can be done when network is available (online)

- The app can be installed via the browser prompt.

Any contribution will be possible when license is added.

<!-- TODO:
- add "who can contribute" details
- change the PWA method (cache first to network first)
- add "sources used" on authors pages
- add contributing, code of conduct, license support ressources...
-->
